# Gone Viral
## a.k.a WHO started this freaking virus?!

## Project Description
Gone Viral or WHO started this freaking virus?! is a deckbuilder card game designed by my wife and I. Last year when everyone went into quarantine, my wife and I happened to get stuck at her parents' house in Canada and couldn't cross the border back to the U.S. We are board and card game enthusiasts and decided to use a lot of our free time to design a card game themed around the various situations we found ourselves, and others, in. Although the game can be categorized as a deckbuilder, each player has their own "role" that gives them a unique objective towards winning the game.

We began playtesting by printing off each card on cardstock but quickly found that making edits to cards/reprints made it extremely time consuming and costly and as I have some experience with mobile app design we decided it best to make the card game into an app first, before eventually moving onto print versions. This project will focus on creating a minimalistic application capable of playing the game with a preset number of players.

## Team
I'm looking for 2 or 3 others to join the implementation team.

## Implementation
I plan on having this a multiplatform mobile application targeting iOS and Android. I have been using Kotlin Multiplatform with extensions in Swift and Java, however I am open to other technologies better suiting the development team.
### SQL
If we continue with Kotlin Multiplatform we would use SqlDelight as it integrates well with Kotlin, however we would use whatever suits the technology best.
### NoSQL
Leaning towards a document NoSQL database, however that may change as the project progresses.

## BOLTS
### Business
This will begin without monetization, but it has the potential to move into that sector.
We plan to quickly implement a "minimal viable product" which can later be developed into a production ready application. Monetization opportunities can be discussed once transition towards production is possible.

### Operation
The project will be operated and maintained by the group members, although operation can be restricted to remaining active members over time if members opt out of operation.

### Legal
This project was designed with the intent of future production and monetization. Each group member must consent to the potential use of their contributions in a produced application. Furthermore, each group member must consent that if they do not continue working on the project through production, they forfeit any share in potential future profits.

### Technical
Our priorities will be:
1. Choose client and server architecture and related programming languages
2. Select an initial SQL database for the prototype
3. Implement the MVP

### Social
We will gain users mainly through word-of-mouth, although all marketing would occur after the creation of the MVP.
